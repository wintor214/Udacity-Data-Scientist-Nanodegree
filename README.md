## Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree
This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a Wine Review dataset found on Kaggle containing approximately 130k reviews from the Wine Enthusiast. I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium which gives the reader insight into the questions posed.

## Project 2: Disaster Response Pipeline
In this project, I built pipelines for analyzing disaster response data from Figure Eight to build a model that classifies disaster messages. The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

## Project 3: Recommendations with IBM
I analysed the interactions that users have with articles and recommended them new articles based on their preferences. I performed EDA, Rank Based Recommendations, User-user Based Collaborative Filtering, and Matrix factorisation for this project.

## Project 4: Starbucks Capstone Project
I analyzed and combined transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.
