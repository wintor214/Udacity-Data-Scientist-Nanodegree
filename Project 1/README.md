## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to better understand:

1. When are home prices the highest in Seattle?
2. Which neighborhoods are the most/least expensive in Seattle?
3. What are the most influential features that affect Seattle home prices?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

Data used in the analysis comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). It contains 3 files:

1. calendar.csv: calendar availability of listings and price
2. listings.csv: information about all the available listings
3. reviews.csv: listing reviews by the users

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://github.com/wintor214/Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree-Project-1).
Feel free to check out a quick summary of the project results [here](https://medium.com/@winston21491/seattle-airbnb-udacity-project-bbdfa8bfa49).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I would like to give credit to Kaggle for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here.
